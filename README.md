# Brief description
The assignment required to implement a contract for the [VickreyAuction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) and one for another kind of auction, chosen between [English Auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction) and [Dutch Auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction). I choose the first one.
